# Final Project
Use this `REAMDE.md` file to describe your final project (as detailed on Canvas).

# Field of Interest
For this project, our field of interest is food. Our group is interested in this area for the data
visualization project because food scarcity and accessibility is a major public health issue
as well as obviously being a fundamental element for human survival. Food scarcity and accessibility
are major issues in the public health industry.

# Examples of Projects done in this area
https://nifa.usda.gov/program/hunger-food-security-programs
This site briefly discusses some major grant and education programs that have been established to address the issue of hunger in the United States.

This is a project focused on finding and mapping food deserts in Seattle compared to locations of low income housing.

This is a project that is looking at food insecurity across the US. They have great data visualization to view the data. As well as totals and averages to aggregate the data in a clear way.

# Data Driven Questions:
- Which countries and regions are experiencing similar levels of success or challenge in regards to food prices, poverty, and population nourishment? We can answer this by finding the averages between countries and group by continents to compare our three factors.
- How do the trends of food prices, poverty levels, and nourished people fluctuate over time and do the fluctuations correspond with each other?  We can examine data about poverty levels and food prices from the same time periods as well as data on malnourishment and by comparing these pieces of data, we can look for a trend between these factors. We can examine if increasing food prices may be correlated with poverty and malnourishment.
- Do food prices correlate to growth in the food insecure/undernourished population?  We can calculate the average food prices per year and the average undernourished population per year and map them over time to see if when food prices go up so do the number of undernourished people and vice versa.

# 3 major subtopics related to this area of research
- Global food price
- Global poverty levels
- Number of undernourished

# Possible Datasets and information about them
## [Global Food Prices](https://www.kaggle.com/jboysen/global-food-prices)
- This dataset was downloaded from kaggle.com
- This data was collected and compiled by the World Food Program and it was distributed by HDX.  This data focuses on providing information on food prices from developing countries. The dataset also has information quantities of food goods and prices of food in the local currencies.
- This data has 743,915 rows and 18 columns
- Questions that we can answer using this dataset are obviously information about how food prices vary from place to place and we can use this information to compare prices to food accessibility and malnourishment

## [- SDG Indicators](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/?indicator=2.1.1)
- We downloaded this data from the UN Sustainable Development Goals website (2.1.1 Series: Prevalence of Undernourishment)
- This data was produced on a regular basis by the designated agency for global monitoring, based on country data. The data is focused on the number of undernourished people by millions per country between 2000 and 2017.
- There are 295 rows and 27 columns
- This can help to answer our question pertaining to the correlation of food prices and undernourished populations as well as global geographic trends and fluctuations.

## [Poverty and Equity | Databank](https://databank.worldbank.org/source/poverty-and-equity)
- We found this data from the World Bank who are the host of the data. The data itself compiled from officially recognized international sources.
- The data is collected according to the data they receive from countries that participate and share their data with them.
- This data is continuously updated so we donâ€™t have an actual number.
- This can help to answer our questions by looking at the poverty and equity levels provided by the data and specify by the countries, year and series of those levels.
